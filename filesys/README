I want to use fat32 file system.  The question is will it fit in the ram
space I have.  It should but other things may suffer.

We should have the file system be compound so CP/M can be a file system
within the FAT32 file system.  Fat does not need to know details about
CP/M file system and viseversa ...  we shall see
