This plan is to create a Z80 multi tasking kernel as a hoby project.

The ultimat goal is to have some fun building a multi tasking kernel for 8 bit CPU's in general.
My first target is the Z80 because I have a lot of them.  Once I get a runnable kernel my plan
is to port to another 8 bit cpu of interest TBD.

Most of the documentation will be in C with semi colons at the end.  I will be documenting in 
plane text as I go along.  Most of the interesting documents will be in the sub directories 
with the code.

I am including the FAT file code base with a few minor tweeks for the special case of disk driver.

Also looking at busybox code as a possible way to get to a working command set quickly.  Size is an
issue however.
