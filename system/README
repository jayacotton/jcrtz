O.k. so here is where the rubber hits the road.

We need to arbitrate between each runnable task, sort out the interrupts
and vectors, and switch in the task that is waiting for and event.

What events are there:

1.  I/O completion event.  I.e.  Read/Write a device either byte or record
2.  Timer event pops.  i.e. Sleep/wake up TOD or wait time out.

Keeps the user memory organized and keep the i/o system pointed in the
correct direction.
