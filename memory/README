The memory is not really all that simple.

First we have 64kb of address range.  Next I need a small bit of code 
at the top of memory to help with page switching.

Next we need to nail down the page size.  And deal with swapping.  
Or not....


How may tasks can be running at one time...  1, how many can the 
system support.... maybe 16
